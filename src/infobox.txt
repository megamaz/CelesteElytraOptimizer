Welcome to Glideline! Some quick tips on using this:
Copy the game state from Studio and paste it into the left box, select your preferred optimization method, and hit optimize.


Here's how each method works:
- Optimized Pullup: Simply generates the inputs to pull-up with the best speed retention.

- Automated Wiggle: Requires the target to be set. 
    Tries a bunch of different wiggle patterns and outputs the best one(s). Use the dropdown on the right to select between one that gets to your target earlier, or with more speed.

- Manual Wiggle: Uses the wiggle data you set to generate a wiggle (wiggles between holding 90 and optimized pull-up.)
    The offset controls how far into the wiggle cycle you start.

A wiggle is a quick alternation between holding a horizontal input to preserve speed, and a vertical input to change your direction. It's more optimal than holding a single direction, since you only lose speed on every other frame.

# Glideline
Optimizes Elytra movement for Celeste.

# Usage
If you're on windows, simply run the `run.bat` provided. It'll create a python venv (virtual environment) in order to avoid installing the requirements to global.

If you're not on windows, then idk gl ig 

# Roadmap
Make a TKinter interactive application in order to optimize elytra movement. This is solely for *upwards* movement, as downwards movement is extremely simple to optimize. If you are unsure about how to optimize downwards movement or how elytra optimizations work in general, please read [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xFF6wjdig5k9vOUF3mAvvWh4pF2HBvOw5PJ-aCNNeTo) which covers everything elytra.

The elytra is incredibly complicated to optimize and no definite "guaranteed faster" solutions have been found. If you know of a way to guarantee a fast path, please dm `megamaz` on discord.

### Planned Features
- A small screen to show predicted flight path (and other interesting info)
- Brute-force fine-tuning
